\chapter{Literature review}\label{chap:Lit}

The following study presents an overview of the current configurations and design techniques for both operational amplifier and current-sensing circuits.
Operational amplifier limitations are considered, as well as the system requirements. These findings are then discussed to ensure that there is
enough information to aid the design process.
