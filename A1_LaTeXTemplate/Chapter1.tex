\chapter{Literature survey}\label{chap:Lit}

Introduce the reader to \textbf{what you want to present} in this chapter (i.e.\ what are you trying to achieve by initiating this communication?).
Try to put yourself in the readers' shoes - what would you \sout{like} need to see to be convinced that the author (1) knew what they were doing and understood what they had to do (2) properly designed for the requirements, (3) simulation-tested their design, and (4) correctly and critically assessed the outcome. 

Include any references to literature you feel is needed. 
In this section, you put a very short summary of information you gathered from literature (papers, web sites, datasheets) that you used to do the design. Be sure to cite the references, which you can add in the \texttt{References.bib} file.
